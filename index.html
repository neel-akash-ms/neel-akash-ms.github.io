            <p>There is no way this site makes top-50, so if you're reading this - you are either the prof or the TA</p>
            <p>
                Cav, let's make a deal - give me full marks for this problem and I'll make an anonymous aggies reddit post, mentioning you as the best prof in the engineering department. (No Cap)<br>Xiangjue, even if you dont give me full marks, I'll make sure to mention Cav that you're the best student-friendly TA ever, and deserve a raise. (No Kappa)

                Established in 1983, Silicon Valley Bank was, just before collapsing, Americas 16th largest commercial bank. It provided banking services to nearly half of all US venture-backed technology and life science companies. It also has operations in Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Sweden and the United Kingdom. SVB benefited hugely from the tech sector's explosive growth in recent years, fueled by ultra-low borrowing costs and a pandemic-induced boom in demand for digital services. The bank's assets, which include loans, more than tripled from $71 billion at the end of 2019 to a peak of $220 billion at the end of March 2022, according to financial statements. Deposits ballooned from $62 billion to $198 billion over that period, as thousands of tech startups parked their cash at the lender. Its global headcount more than doubled. The issue can be fixed by using <u>wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde</u>.
